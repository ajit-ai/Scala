### Scala


Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. It is a pure object-oriented programming language which also provides support to the functional programming approach. Scala programs can convert to bytecodes and can run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Scala stands for Scalable language. It also provides Javascript runtimes. Scala is highly influenced by Java and some other programming languages like Lisp, Haskell, Pizza.


Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. It is a pure object-oriented programming language which also provides the support to the functional programming approach. There is no concept of primitive data as everything is an object in Scala. It is designed to express the general programming patterns in a refined, succinct, and type-safe way. Scala programs can convert to bytecodes and can run on the JVM(Java Virtual Machine). Scala stands for Scalable language. It also provides the JavaScript runtimes. Scala is highly influenced by Java and some other programming languages like Lisp, Haskell, Pizza, etc.

Evolution of Scala:
Scala was designed by the Martin Odersky, professor of programming methods at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland and a German computer scientist. Martin Odersky is also the co-creator of javac (Java Compiler), Generic Java, and EPFL’s Funnel programming language. He started to design the Scala in 2001. Scala was first released publicly in 2004 on the Java platform as its first version. In June 2004, Scala was modified for the .Net Framework. Soon it was followed by second version i.e. (v2.0) in 2006. At JavaOne conference in 2012, Scala was awarded as the winner of the ScriptBowl contest.
